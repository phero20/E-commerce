<br></br>
This is a fully responsive e-commerce platform built with MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js (MERN stack). The admin has full control over adding and managing products. Customers can browse items, add to cart, place orders, and track their order status.

The platform includes sorting, filtering, related products, and demo payments via COD, Stripe, and Razorpay. Images are managed efficiently using Cloudinary, ensuring smooth media handling. The UI, styled with Tailwind CSS, offers a modern and fully responsive experience.
